Metric Builder

Population management starts with an assessment of the entire risk-based population, in order to identify the specific definition 
on which the organization chooses to focus: high risk patients, those with specific chronic disease, and those in need of 
appropriate screenings and primary prevention interventions. Metric Builder helps in reporting the performance of a particular cohort. 
This evaluation and reporting generate actionable insights for various individuals/teams across the care continuum, 
which eventually leads to better quality of life for the patient. Metric Builder is built on SymphonyCare data vault 
and empowers users in coming up with complex queries within minutes via an easy to use interface. Users can input demographic, 
clinical and utilization criteria to identify specific populations of patients, share population definitions with other users, 
and download detailed information on these populations. Below are the functionalities in Metric Builder.
