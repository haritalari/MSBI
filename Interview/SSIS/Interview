• What do we mean by dataflow in SSIS?
   Data flow is nothing but the flow of data from the corresponding sources to the referred destinations. 
   In this process, the data transformations make changes to the data to make it ready for the data warehouse.

• What is a breakpoint in SSIS? How is it setup? How do you disable it?
  A breakpoint is a stopping point in the code. The breakpoint can give the Developer\DBA an
  opportunity to review the status of the data, variables and the overall status of the SSIS package.
    10 unique conditions exist for each breakpoint.
  Breakpoints are setup in BIDS. In BIDS, navigate to the control flow interface. Right click on the
  object where you want to set the breakpoint and select the ‘Edit Breakpoints…’ option.

• What is the use of Bulk Insert Task in SSIS?
   Bulk Insert Task is used to upload large amount of data from flat files into Sql Server. 
   It supports only OLE DB connections for destination database.

• What is Conditional Split transformation in SSIS?
   This is just like IF condition which checks for the given condition and based on the condition evaluation, 
   the output will be sent to the appropriate OUTPUT path. It has ONE input and MANY outputs. 
   Conditional Split transformation is used to send paths to different outputs based on some conditions. 
   For example, we can organize the transform for the students in a class who have marks greater than 40 to one path 
   and the students who score less than 40 to another path.
   
• How do you eliminate quotes from being uploaded from a flat file to SQL Server? 
   This can be done using TEXT QUALIFIER property. In the SSIS package on the Flat File Connection Manager Editor, 
   enter quotes into the Text qualifier field then preview the data to ensure the quotes are not included.   
   
• Can you explain how to setup a checkpoint file in SSIS?
   Checkpoint in SSIS:- Restart of packages from point of failure.
   The following items need to be configured on the properties tab for SSIS package:
   
   • CheckpointFileName:– Specify the full path to the Checkpoint file that the package uses to save the value of package variables 
   and log completed tasks. Rather than using a hard-coded path as shown above, it’s a good idea to use an expression that 
   concatenates a path defined in a package variable and the package name.
   
   • CheckpointUsage:– Determines if/how checkpoints are used. Choose from these options: 
   1) Never: The package will not use a checkpoint file and therefore will never restart.
   2) If Exists: If a checkpoint file exists in the place you specified for the CheckpointFilename property, 
                 then it will be used, and the package will restart according to the checkpoints written.
   3) Always: The package will always use a checkpoint file to restart, and if one does not exist, the package will fail.
  
   • SaveCheckpoints:– Choose from these options: True or False (default). You must select True to implement the Checkpoint behavior.
   
   • The more one property you have to set on the task is FailPackageOnFailure. This must be set for each task or container that you 
   want to be the point for a checkpoint and restart. If you do not set this property to true and the task fails, no file will be 
   written, and the next time you invoke the package, it will start from the beginning again.
   
• Can you explain different options for dynamic configurations in SSIS?
     1) XML file
     2) custom variables
     3) Database per environment with the variables
     4) Use a centralized database with all variables
     
• What is the use of Percentage Sampling transformation in SSIS?
   Percentage Sampling transformation is generally used for data mining. This transformation builds a random sample of set of output 
   rows by choosing specified percentage of input rows. For example if the input has 1000 rows and if I specify 10 as percentage 
   sample then the transformation returns 10% of the RANDOM records from the input data.     

• What is the use of Term Extraction transformation in SSIS?
   Term Extraction transformation is used to extract nouns or noun phrases or both noun and noun phrases only from English text. 
   It extracts terms from text in a transformation input column and then writes the terms to a transformation output column. 
   It can be also used to find out the content of a dataset.
   
• What is Data Viewer and what are the different types of Data Viewers in SSIS?
   A Data Viewer allows viewing data at a point of time at runtime. If data viewer is placed before and after the Aggregate transform, 
   we can see data flowing to the transformation at the runtime and how it looks like after the transformation occurred. 
   The different types of data viewers are:
      1. Grid
      2. Histogram
      3. Scatter Plot
      4. Column Chart.   

• What is Ignore Failure option in SSIS?
   In Ignore Failure option, the error will be ignored and the data row will be directed to continue on the next transformation. 
   Let’s say you have some JUNK data(wrong type of data or JUNK data) flowing from source, then using this option in SSIS 
   we can REDIRECT the junk data records to another transformation instead of FAILING the package. 
   This helps to MOVE only valid data to destination and JUNK can be captured into separate file.

   For example, we can configure Work Flow when ANY task Failes or Stops or Starts ..

• What is the function of Package explorer tab in SSIS?
   This tab provides an explorer view of the package. You can see what is happening in the package. 
   The Package is a container at the top of the hierarchy.

• What is Solution Explorer?
   It is a place in SSIS Designer where all the projects, Data Sources, Data Source Views and other miscellaneous files 
   can be viewed and accessed for modification.
   
• How do we convert data type in SSIS?
   The Data Conversion Transformation in SSIS converts the data type of an input column to a different data type.   
   
• How are variables useful in ssis package?
   Variables can provide communication among objects in the package. Variables can provide communication between parent and 
   child packages. Variables can also be used in expressions and scripts. This helps in providing dynamic values to tasks.   
   
• Explain Aggregate Transformation in SSIS?
   It aggregates data, similar you do in applying TSQL functions like Group By, Min, Max, Avg, and Count.   
   
• Explain Audit Transformation ?
   It allows you to add auditing information as required in auditing world specified by HIPPA and Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX). 
   Auditing options that you can add to transformed data through this transformation are :
   1. Execution of Instance GUID : ID of execution instance of the package
   2. PackageID : ID of the package
   3. PackageName
   4. VersionID : GUID version of the package
   5. Execution StartTime
   6. MachineName
   7. UserName

   If you define it as new column, specify new column name. Operations available here are:
   1. Uppercase
   2. Lowercase
   3. Byte reversal : such as from 0x1234 to 0x4321
   4. Full width
   5. Half width
   6. Hiragana/katakana/traditional Chinese/simplified Chinese
   7. Linguistic casing   
   
• Explain Copy column Transformation?
   This component simply copies a column to another new column. Just like ALIAS Column in T-Sql.

• Explain Data conversion Transformation?
   This component does conversion data type, similar to TSQL function CAST or CONVERT. 
   If you wish to convery the data from one type to another then this is the best bet. 
   But please make sure that you have COMPATABLE data in the column.
   
• Explain Data Mining query Transformation?
   This component does prediction on the data or fills gap on it. Some good scenarios uses this component is:
   1. Take some input columns as number of children, domestic income, and marital income to predict whether someone owns a house or not.
   2. Take prediction what a customer would buy based analysis buying pattern on their shopping cart.
   3. Filling blank data or default values when customer doesn’t fill some items in the questionnaire.

• Explain Derived column Transformation?
   Derived column creates new column or put manipulation of several columns into new column. You can directly copy existing or 
   create a new column using more than one column also.   
   
• Explain Merge Transformation?
   Merge transformation merges two paths into single path. It is useful when you want to break out data into path that 
   handles errors after the errors are handled, the data are merge back into downstream or you want to merge 2 data sources. 
   It is similar with Union All transformation, but Merge has some restrictions :
   1. Data should be in sorted order
   2. Data type , data length and other meta data attribute must be similar before merged.
   
• Explain Union all Transformation?
   It works in opposite way to Merge transformation. It can take output from more than 2 input paths and combines into 
   single output path.   

• Explain Merge Join Transformation?
   Merge Join transformation will merge output from 2 inputs and doing INNER or OUTER join on the data. 
   But if you the data come from 1 OLEDB data source, it is better you join through SQL query rather than using Merge Join 
   transformation. Merge Join is intended to join 2 different data source.

• Explain Multicast Transformation?
   This transformation sends output to multiple output paths with no conditional as Conditional Split does. 
   Takes ONE Input and makes the COPY of data and passes the same data through many outputs. 
   In simple Give one input and take many outputs of the same data.   
   
• Explain Percentage and row sampling Transformations?
   This transformation will take data from source and randomly sampling data. It gives you 2 outputs. 
   First is selected data and second one is unselected data. It is used in situation where you train data mining model. 
   These two are used to take the SAMPLE of data from the input data.

• Explain Sort Transformation?
   This component will sort data, similar in TSQL command ORDER BY. Some transformations need sorted data.  
   
• What r the possible locations to save SSIS package?
   You can save a package wherever you want.
   SQL Server
   Package Store
   File System

• What is a package?
   A discrete executable unit of work composed of a collection of control flow and other objects, including data sources, 
   transformations, process sequence, and rules, errors and event handling, and data destinations.   
 
• What is a workflow in SSIS?
   A workflow is a set of instructions on how to execute tasks.
   (It is a set of instructions on how to execute tasks such as sessions, emails and shell commands. 
   a workflow is created form work flow mgr.

• What is the diff between control flow Items and data flow Items?
   The control flow is the highest level control process. It allows you to manage the run-time process activities of data flow and 
   other processes within a package.
   When we want to extract, transform and load data within a package. You add an SSIS dataflow task to the package control flow.
   
• What are the main component of SSIS(project-architecture)?
   SSIS archItecture has 4 main components
   1.ssis service
   2.ssis runtime engine & runtime executables
   3.ssis dataflow engine & dataflow components
   4.ssis clients

• Different components in SSIS package?
   Control flow
   Data flow
   Event handler
   Package explorer   
   
 • What are Connection Managers?
   It is a bridge b/w package object and physical data. It provides logical representation of a connection at design time 
   the properties of the connection mgr describes the physical connection that integration services creates when the package is run. 
   
• What is environment variable in SSIS?
   An environment variable configuration sets a package property equal to the value in an environment variable.
   Environmental configurations are useful for configuring properties that are dependent on the computer that is executing the package.

• How to provide securIty to packages?
   We can provide security in two ways
   1. Package encryption
   2. Password protection.   

• What are Precedence constraints?
   Constraints that link executable, container, and tasks wIthin the package control flow and specify condItion that determine 
   the sequence and condItions for determine whether executable run.
   
• What is Design time Deployment in SSIS ?
   When you run a package from with in BIDS,it is built and temporarily deployed to the folder. By default the package will be 
   deployed to the BIN folder in the Package’s Project folder and you can configure for custom folder for deployment. 
   When the Package’s execution is completed and stopped in BIDS,the deployed package will be deleted and this is called as 
   Design Time Deployment.   
   
• Difference between Merge and Merge Join Transformation.
    Merge is a combining sorted data from 2 data sources..it is similar to union all but the data coming from sources must be sorted .
    Where as Merge join, similar to that of SQL joins, is used to join the data sources based on a column (columns).
