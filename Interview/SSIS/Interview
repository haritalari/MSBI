• What do we mean by dataflow in SSIS?
   Data flow is nothing but the flow of data from the corresponding sources to the referred destinations. 
   In this process, the data transformations make changes to the data to make it ready for the data warehouse.

• What is a breakpoint in SSIS? How is it setup? How do you disable it?
  A breakpoint is a stopping point in the code. The breakpoint can give the Developer\DBA an
  opportunity to review the status of the data, variables and the overall status of the SSIS package.
    10 unique conditions exist for each breakpoint.
  Breakpoints are setup in BIDS. In BIDS, navigate to the control flow interface. Right click on the
  object where you want to set the breakpoint and select the ‘Edit Breakpoints…’ option.

• What is the use of Bulk Insert Task in SSIS?
   Bulk Insert Task is used to upload large amount of data from flat files into Sql Server. 
   It supports only OLE DB connections for destination database.

• What is Conditional Split transformation in SSIS?
   This is just like IF condition which checks for the given condition and based on the condition evaluation, 
   the output will be sent to the appropriate OUTPUT path. It has ONE input and MANY outputs. 
   Conditional Split transformation is used to send paths to different outputs based on some conditions. 
   For example, we can organize the transform for the students in a class who have marks greater than 40 to one path 
   and the students who score less than 40 to another path.
   
• How do you eliminate quotes from being uploaded from a flat file to SQL Server? 
   This can be done using TEXT QUALIFIER property. In the SSIS package on the Flat File Connection Manager Editor, 
   enter quotes into the Text qualifier field then preview the data to ensure the quotes are not included.   
   
• Can you explain how to setup a checkpoint file in SSIS?
   Checkpoint in SSIS:- Restart of packages from point of failure.
   The following items need to be configured on the properties tab for SSIS package:
   
   • CheckpointFileName:– Specify the full path to the Checkpoint file that the package uses to save the value of package variables 
   and log completed tasks. Rather than using a hard-coded path as shown above, it’s a good idea to use an expression that 
   concatenates a path defined in a package variable and the package name.
   
   • CheckpointUsage:– Determines if/how checkpoints are used. Choose from these options: 
   1) Never: The package will not use a checkpoint file and therefore will never restart.
   2) If Exists: If a checkpoint file exists in the place you specified for the CheckpointFilename property, 
                 then it will be used, and the package will restart according to the checkpoints written.
   3) Always: The package will always use a checkpoint file to restart, and if one does not exist, the package will fail.
  
   • SaveCheckpoints:– Choose from these options: True or False (default). You must select True to implement the Checkpoint behavior.
   
   • The more one property you have to set on the task is FailPackageOnFailure. This must be set for each task or container that you 
   want to be the point for a checkpoint and restart. If you do not set this property to true and the task fails, no file will be 
   written, and the next time you invoke the package, it will start from the beginning again.
   
• Can you explain different options for dynamic configurations in SSIS?
     1) XML file
     2) custom variables
     3) Database per environment with the variables
     4) Use a centralized database with all variables
     
• What is the use of Percentage Sampling transformation in SSIS?
   Percentage Sampling transformation is generally used for data mining. This transformation builds a random sample of set of output 
   rows by choosing specified percentage of input rows. For example if the input has 1000 rows and if I specify 10 as percentage 
   sample then the transformation returns 10% of the RANDOM records from the input data.     

• What is the use of Term Extraction transformation in SSIS?
   Term Extraction transformation is used to extract nouns or noun phrases or both noun and noun phrases only from English text. 
   It extracts terms from text in a transformation input column and then writes the terms to a transformation output column. 
   It can be also used to find out the content of a dataset.
   
• What is Data Viewer and what are the different types of Data Viewers in SSIS?
   A Data Viewer allows viewing data at a point of time at runtime. If data viewer is placed before and after the Aggregate transform, 
   we can see data flowing to the transformation at the runtime and how it looks like after the transformation occurred. 
   The different types of data viewers are:
      1. Grid
      2. Histogram
      3. Scatter Plot
      4. Column Chart.   

• What is Ignore Failure option in SSIS?
   In Ignore Failure option, the error will be ignored and the data row will be directed to continue on the next transformation. 
   Let’s say you have some JUNK data(wrong type of data or JUNK data) flowing from source, then using this option in SSIS 
   we can REDIRECT the junk data records to another transformation instead of FAILING the package. 
   This helps to MOVE only valid data to destination and JUNK can be captured into separate file.
