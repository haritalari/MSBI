• What is a breakpoint in SSIS? How is it setup? How do you disable it?
  A breakpoint is a stopping point in the code. The breakpoint can give the Developer\DBA an
  opportunity to review the status of the data, variables and the overall status of the SSIS package.
    10 unique conditions exist for each breakpoint.
  Breakpoints are setup in BIDS. In BIDS, navigate to the control flow interface. Right click on the
  object where you want to set the breakpoint and select the ‘Edit Breakpoints…’ option.
